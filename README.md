This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Brief libraries intro

As it was stated to provide a breif explanation of the libraries used in this project, here is a list of the libraries used in this project:

#### RadixUI

I chose RadixUI because it offers accessible, unstyled UI primitives that adhere to WAI-ARIA standards, ensuring that components are highly accessible and compliant with best practices. The flexibility of RadixUI allows for easy customization, making it simple to style components according to project requirements without being tied to a specific design system. Additionally, RadixUI is highly composable, allowing me to build complex components using a straightforward API, which improves development speed and code maintainability.

#### Shadcn UI CLI

The Shadcn UI CLI was used for generating components because it streamlines the component development process by providing a set of customizable, pre-built components. It allows for rapid prototyping and consistent styling across the application, leveraging Tailwind CSS. The CLI reduces boilerplate code and setup time, enabling a faster development workflow. It also integrates seamlessly with RadixUI, enhancing the accessibility and usability of generated components. This combination ensures a scalable and maintainable component architecture, which aligns well with modern best practices.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
